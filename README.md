# Sales-Person-Analysis-Dashboard


### Problem Statement

Businesses often face challenges in understanding their sales performance across different dimensions such as salespersons, regions, and products. This dashboard addresses the problem by visualizing sales data to:

Track sales trends over time.

Identify top-performing salespersons and regions.

Highlight the most popular products.

Provide real-time insights with interactive filters.




### Main Components of the Project:
1. Sales Trend Analysis: Tracks the sales performance over time, revealing patterns such as peak sales periods and seasonal fluctuations.
2. Salesperson Performance: Provides a leaderboard of sales representatives, ranking them based on total sales amounts, allowing managers to assess individual contributions.
3. Sales by Region: Highlights the contribution of different regions (countries) to overall sales, helping businesses understand geographic strengths and weaknesses.
4. Sales by Product: Displays product-wise sales performance, helping the company identify its most and least popular products.
5. Interactive Filters: Users can slice and dice the data by date range, salesperson, region, or product to obtain specific insights as needed.

### Key Features:
- Sales Tracking: Visualizes total sales over time, allowing users to monitor growth and dips in sales figures.
- Product Analysis: Ranks products based on sales, giving a clear picture of bestsellers and underperforming products.
- Regional Insights: Provides a detailed breakdown of sales by geographic regions, allowing the organization to tailor regional strategies.
- Salesperson Insights: Ranks individual salespersons by performance, facilitating better recognition and potential training opportunities.
- Interactive and Customizable Dashboard: Users can explore the data by applying filters, adjusting time ranges, and drilling down into specific sales metrics for further analysis.

### Goals:
The primary goal of the project is to provide actionable insights through data visualization, enabling businesses to:
- Identify high-performing salespersons and reward them accordingly.
- Pinpoint regions and products that need more attention or improvement.
- Understand sales trends and make proactive decisions to sustain or increase revenue growth.
- Monitor performance against targets and adjust strategies to meet business goals.

### Questions (KPIs)  
-Who are the top-performing salespersons based on total sales?
-Which regions (countries) are contributing the most to total sales?
-What are the top-selling products, and how much do they contribute to the overall sales?
-What is the overall total sales amount and the number of units sold during the period?
-How does each salesperson's performance trend over the selected time period?
-How do sales metrics (total sales, product performance, salesperson performance) vary over a specific time range?

### Steps followed 
1.	Data Collection: Gather sales data (salespersons, products, regions, dates, amounts).
2.	Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
3.	Data Modeling: Create relationships between tables (sales transactions, salespersons, products, regions) and calculate aggregated values.
4.	Dashboard Design: Develop visualizations like line charts (sales trends), pie charts (sales by region), and bar charts (product performance) with interactive filters and KPIs (total sales, units sold).
5.	Interactivity: Add dynamic slicers (date, salesperson) to enable drill-down analysis.
6.	Testing & Refinement: Ensure accuracy, validate data, and improve user interface for clarity.
7.	Insights & Deployment: Analyze trends, derive insights, and publish the dashboard for stakeholders with regular updates.
